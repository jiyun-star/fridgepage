        <p><strong>Academic Title:</strong> Ingredient Recognition Recipe Recommendation App</p>
        <p><strong>Commercial Title:</strong> Fridgemate</p>
        <p><strong>Project Description:</strong><br> 
This project is a mobile-friendly web application designed to help users reduce food waste by allowing them to upload photos of ingredients from their refrigerator or pantry. The application uses a deep learning-based image recognition model which has been trained on a large dataset of food images to accurately identify various food items. The model utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to detect ingredients in the uploaded photos, even if the items are partially obscured or not perfectly aligned.

Once the ingredients are recognized, the application displays a list of identified items back to the user. Based on the identified ingredients, the application then leverages a recommendation engine to suggest recipes that can be prepared with the available ingredients. The system draws from a curated database of recipes, filtering suggestions to only include those that can be made with what the user currently has at home.

This approach not only helps users cook with ingredients they already own, but it also aims to reduce food waste by encouraging more efficient meal planning and utilizing leftover items.
